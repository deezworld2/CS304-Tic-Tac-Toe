# Tic Tac Toe

This project was developed as an assignment for my Software Engineering class at my university. This was a solo project, and all source code used in the project is either supplied by my university or written by myself.

## Introduction
The idea of this assignment/project was to create a simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe, complete with a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
